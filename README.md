### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQraviuwbzU) - Learned a lot from this video. I was struggling a bit with responsiveness early on, but was able to complete the challenge after watching this and using clamp().
- [David Gilbertson - FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862/) - At first, I did not understand much about breakpoints and does not know how to do it. I found this article from the video above, and it helped me a lot too.
- [Ryan Feigenbaum - GitHub](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) - I used clamp() a lot in this challenge for fluid typography, to calculate manually would take a lot of time. So this calculator helped speed up the process. There are other sites but this one have a simple design, which is a plus to me.
